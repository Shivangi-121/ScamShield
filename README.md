## 🌟 Overview
**ScamShield** is a cutting-edge, real-time security platform designed to protect users from the increasing wave of digital fraud. By leveraging **Hybrid AI** (Machine Learning + Rule-based Heuristics), ScamShield analyzes text, URLs, and even live voice conversations to identify potential scams before they cause harm.

Our mission is to provide **Explainable AI**—not just telling you something is a scam, but explaining *why* it was flagged, empowering users with knowledge and safety.

## ✨ Why ScamShield Stands Out
> **AI that not only detects scams — but explains them.**

### 🛠️ Unique Capabilities
- **Behavior-Based Detection**: Identifies urgency language, repeated manipulation patterns, and pressure tactics in real time.
- **Scam Type Classification**: Categorizes threats as Phishing, Job Scam, or Banking Fraud for targeted user guidance.
- **Explainable AI**: Surfaces the exact trigger words and risk factors behind every detection decision.

### 🌍 Real-World Impact
- **Prevent Financial Fraud**: Stop scams before users act on them to prevent monetary loss.
- **Increase Awareness**: Educate users during the detection process so they recognize scams independently over time.
- **Accessible for Everyone**: Designed with a clean, intuitive interface for non-technical users of all backgrounds.

### 📩 1. Text Scam Detector
Harnesses the power of NLP to dissect messages for deceptive patterns.
- **AI Classification**: Real-time prediction using a trained Scikit-Learn model.
- **Probability Scoring**: Get a precise risk percentage (0-100%).
- **Smart Labels**: Dynamic classification as **Safe**, **Suspicious**, or **Scam**.
- **Contextual Insights**: Detects urgency, authority impersonation, and financial bait.
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Automatically identifies and flags high-risk words within the text.

### 🔗 2. URL Scam Analyzer
Deep-dives into link structures to prevent phishing attacks.
- **Heuristic Engine**: Checks protocol security (HTTPS), subdomain counts, and domain length.
- **Phishing Detection**: Identifies suspicious keywords like *login, bank, verify, secure*.
- **Visual Risk Meter**: A sleek progress bar visualizing the threat level.
- **Explainable Results**: Detailed breakdown of every risk factor found in the URL.

### 🎤 3. Voice Scam Detector (New!)
Live analysis for voice calls and conversations.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Real-time transcription using the browser's Speech Recognition API.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Choose between **English 🇺🇸** and **Hindi 🇮🇳**.
- **Real-time Pipeline**: Streamed transcription is instantly sent to the ML backend for analysis.
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated voice waveform during active listening.

## 🧠 The "Hybrid AI" Engine

ScamShield doesn't just rely on one method. It uses a **multi-layered approach**:

1.  **Machine Learning Layer**: A `CountVectorizer` + `Naive Bayes` model trained on a massive spam dataset (`spam.csv`).
2.  **Heuristic Layer**: A custom Python engine that evaluates sentiment, urgency, and specific fraud indicators.
3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Detects URL obfuscation and character-swapping tricks used by scammers.
4.  **Ensemble Score**: Combines ML probability with heuristic risk scores for a high-precision final result.
